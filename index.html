    <p>
      Hello my name is Dennis Anokye, I was born to a loving parent in a remote village in the Ashanti Region of Ghana
      called Dompoase. I currently live and work in Accra. Some of my cherished hobbies include reading, singing,
      writing my own songs, listening to inspiring audios such as conference talks, podcast, music etc, with interests
      in diverse research topics such as nature, culture, arts, creativity, and environmental conservation.
      I continue to seek knowledge, inspire change, and embrace the values that shape life, standing firm in my faith
      and passions. I have passion in developing an app for farmers in remote areas to enable them to have access to
      information and resources. So I am currently studying Software Development in BYU-Idaho to hone my skills.

    Accra, the capital city of Ghana, is a vibrant and rapidly growing metropolis that blends rich tradition with
    modern progress. Located along the Gulf of Guinea, the city is a cultural hub, home to historic landmarks,
    colorful markets, music, dance, and festivals that reflect the diverse ethnic groups, especially the Ga people.
    Accra also boasts top educational institutions such as the University of Ghana, Ashesi University, and several
    international schools. With hospitality homes like Movenpic Ambassador Hotel, Marriott Hotel, and Holiday Inn,
    Accra has a stable political climate, improving infrastructure, tech innovation hubs, and a growing middle class.
    The modern international airport is also located here, making it an attractive destination for foreign investors
    seeking opportunities in sectors like real estate, fintech, education, and tourism. – Wikipedia
