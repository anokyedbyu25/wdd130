        <p>Hello my name is Dennis Anokye, I was born to a loving parent in a remote village in the Ashanti Region of Ghana called Dompoase. 
            I currently live and work in Accra. Some of my cherished hobbies include reading, singing, writing my own songs, listening to inspiring audios such as 
            conference talks, podcast, music etc, with interests in divers research topics such as nature, culture, arts, creativity, and environmental conservation.
            I continue to seek knowledge, inspire change, and embrace the values that shapes life, standing firm in my faith and passions. I have passion in developing an app for farmers in remote areas to enable then have access to information and resources. So I am currently studying Software Development in BYU-Idaho to hone my skills.</p>
